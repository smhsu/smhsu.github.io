			<h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">Hello!</h1>
			<p class="mb-4">
				Iâ€™m a 6th year PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at
				Urbana-Champaign.  In Fall 2024 I will start as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at California
				Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-4">
				I work in <b>Human-Computer Interaction</b>, especially (1) AI content curation
				systems (e.g. Facebook News Feed) and (2) AI feedback systems in education.  My research considers how
				these systems erode users' autonomy (e.g. how the systems fail to consider users' wishes with dignity),
				and examines what interface design decisions and regulations help resolve these issues.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-4">
				While I most often work on the interface design of AI systems, I'm also interested in and have done work
				in music education software and visualization tools for biologists.  Please contact me if you want
				to work with me in any of these areas!
